                The Economics of a Collaborative Illusion
              </h2>
              <p class="summary">
                There&#8217;s been an implicit contract between
                the people who build web properties, and the
                people who use them: &#8220;Let&#8217;s keep it
                real&#8221;
              </p>
              <p>
                Many people don&#8217;t really have a sense of
                the enormous, sustained effort that goes into
                maintaining the illusion of a persistent
                &#8220;website&#8221;. Even the simplest site is
                a churning mass of moving parts that are being
                corralled and wrestled into place, over and over
                &#8211; style sheets, image files, code
                fragments. Enterprise e-commerce sites have gone
                far, far past that level of complexity. Every
                time you load a &#8220;page&#8221; at an Amazon
                or a Dell, you&#8217;re summoning information
                from dozens or hundreds of different machines,
                scattered all over the country. The investment in
                machines, applications and people it takes to
                bring all those pieces together &#8211; and then
                make them fit together into the illusion of a
                persistent &#8220;site&#8221; every time, for
                every visitor &#8211; can be staggering.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Sooo&#8230;why does this matter?
              </h3>
              <p>
                It matters because the sites we&#8217;ve all
                grown used to &#8211; sites that look pretty much
                the same every time you go back, and that look
                pretty much the same for you as they do for your
                mom &#8211; never acted that way because they
                intrinsically &#8220;have&#8221; to.
                There&#8217;s been a massive investment in people
                and equipment to maintain an &#8220;illusion of
                permanence&#8221; because there are deep
                sociological and economic incentives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Those incentives have been gradually eroding for
                years, but they&#8217;ve never really been
                attacked by anything so transformational and
                massive as the new Facebook tools.

                that reaches back to ancient Greece and the

                basic concept is pretty straightforward :
                it&#8217;s the conceptual error of looking at a
                dynamic &#8220;process&#8221;, and mistaking it
                for a static &#8220;thing&#8221;. The Buddha,
                Prof. Whitehead and the Greek philosopher
                Heraclitus all saw our tendency to make that
                mistake as a central flaw in the human condition.
                I agree, but I think there are some important
                qualifications.

                While thinking of a complex process as a simpler
                object may not be correct, it is a powerful
                mental shortcut. As long as the
                &#8220;object&#8221; we have in mind is accurate
                enough that we can use it successfully, we can
                take advantage of the process without confronting
                the added complexity of the process. That&#8217;s
                not just a convenience &#8211; it was clearly a
                critical step in the evolution of human
                consciousness, that allowed us to move forward,
                faster. (No, I don&#8217;t have a reference.
                Prove me wrong.)
              </p>
              <p>
                That matters for our discussion on two levels.
                First of all, the mental model of a persistent
                website that sits there like the corner store is
                just easier for people to process. It&#8217;s not
                just that it borrows the convenient metaphors of
                a &#8220;place&#8221; or a &#8220;store&#8221;.
                The simple qualities of permanence and
                persistence strike deep psychological chords
                &#8211; they imply predictability, and
                understandability, and the web&#8217;s rate of
                adoption has clearly benefited from them.
              </p>
              <p>
                That mental shortcut of concreteness, though,
                also makes online properties easier to
                <em>create</em>. Designing something that you
                think of as a single &#8220;site&#8221; can take
                a lot of effort to <em>build</em> later on, but
                it&#8217;s a lot easier to think about when
                you&#8217;re getting started.

                Nevertheless, as powerful as it might be, that
                fallacy is a misunderstanding of reality. While
                there are benefits, there are costs. Many of our
                most important cultural and scientific advances
                have come by confronting the fact that something
                is not a thing, but a process &#8211; look at the
                way that quantum physics turned Bohr&#8217;s
                little billiard-balls into buzzing particle
                clouds, or that <a title=

                When the seething realities of a process finally
                stop playing nice within our tidy mental model,
                we really have two choices &#8211; we can fight
                to maintain our mental shortcut, or we can
                acknowledge the fallacy and move on.

                That human bias for the concrete has encouraged
                marketers to put a lot of effort into maintaining

                important, the real forces that will drive
                what&#8217;s going to happen are economic. First
                and foremost, it means that almost any major site
                today is basically a huge &#8220;homogenization
                mill&#8221; &#8211; by offering a massively
                consistent, simplified experience, it grinds

                  My goal is to eventually explore all these
                  implications in more depth over time. For the
                  moment, though, I&#8217;m planning to look at
                  issues surrounding individual identity next
                  &#8212; how various theories of &#8220;the
                  self&#8221; will intersect with these trends to
                  threaten or empower us.

                  The &#8220;equal and opposite&#8221; reaction
                  to the disintegration of the website is going
                  to be the reintegration of persistent, coherent
                  personal identities. That&#8217;s
                  <strong>not</strong> an endorsement of
                  Facebook&#8217;s efforts to own those
                  identities, but &#8212; for better or worse
                  &#8212; it&#8217;s an enormously powerful
                  consequence of these trends.

                  There are actually two broad categories of
                  tools that were announced at Facebook&#8217;s
                  F8 conference.

                  <li>The new <a href=
                  "http://developers.facebook.com/plugins"
                    target="_blank">Social Plug-ins</a> can be
                    easily added to any property, and while
                    they&#8217;re quite powerful, as their name
                    implies, they are modular services that can
                    be added or removed. Technically, the
                    plug-ins don&#8217;t even need to give a site
                    access to your FB data, although I believe
                    they can if you give explicit permission.

                    Personalization&#8221; program</a> (bottom of
                    page) goes much deeper &#8212; it allows
                    developers to integrate Facebook directly
                    into a site&#8217;s data and functionality.
                    By definition, a site that uses Instant
                    Personalization expects to have direct access
                    to your personal FB data.

                  Before anyone insists those things could never
                  happen to <em>them</em>, because they would
                  never let Facebook share their personal
                  information like that, or that I&#8217;m
                  somehow advocating this to come about, let me
                  just say this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Personally, I feel personal privacy is an
                  enormously important issue, and I have really
                  deep reservations and concerns about how this
                  could all play out. But, for one thing,
                  &#8220;privacy&#8221; is such a big topic that
                  it&#8217;s like &#8220;gravity&#8221;.
                  It&#8217;s always there, but if you always gave
                  it its due, you&#8217;d never talk about
                  anything else. I am genuinely interested in
                  exploring the morality of the privacy issue,
                  but there&#8217;s no way to do that fairly here
                  and stay focused.
                  </li>
                  <li>As to whether or not this is a
                  <em>valid</em> prediction, I honestly
                  don&#8217;t see how something along these lines
                  doesn&#8217;t eventually come to be. Maybe
                  it&#8217;s not through Facebook. Maybe
                  it&#8217;s in 15 years and not 5. Hopefully
                  it&#8217;s because the recipient is totally OK
                  with it. No matter what, though, I really
                  can&#8217;t imagine that it never happens.

                    Brilliant, man. Just brilliant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I did think of one issue that you
                    haven&#8217;t yet addressed, a huge issue
                    that would probably merit one of
                    those&#8211;again, brilliant&#8211;graphic
                    rest stops that you&#8217;re fond of, an
                    issue that has contributed more to the
                    Internet than Amazon and Facebook combined,
                    an issue that WILL impede the Like
                    juggernaut.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Porn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not just porn, actually, but any site that
                    with which we do and yet do not want to be
                    associated. Man&#8217;s inherent duality
                    demands not only an illusion of online
                    privacy but also that the Internet afford us
                    more than a single identity. As Joe Browser
                    becomes aware of the ramifications of
                    clicking Like, he&#8217;ll become more and
                    more hesitant to do so. It comes down to Like
                    vs. privacy, and any future paradigm must
                    consider both.

                        Point definitely taken. I&#8217;m still
                        working out how I want to pull together
                        my thoughts on that front, but one of the
                        things I want to dig into are the
                        parallel issues around the idea of a
                        &#8220;self&#8221; &#8212; the added
                        leverage that we may (or may not) see
                        around our online identity won&#8217;t
                        come from having some some, single static
                        &#8220;me&#8221; emerge. If it comes at
                        all, it&#8217;s going to come from our
                        ability to _control_ who we are &#8212;
                        in any given context &#8212; from a
                        central point.

                  Thinking really hard about an idea doesn't make
                  you a traitor, and it doesn't make you a
                  partisan. It makes you smart.

                  If you think I'm betraying your morals by
                  paying careful attention to something that
                  pisses you off, you should stop reading right
                  now. It will make us both much happier.

                  OTOH, no coherent discussion can account for
                  everything. An examination carried out in good
                  faith isn't "wrong" because it sets aside an
                  important issue. At worst, it's incomplete. At
                  best, it's disciplined.

                  A little while ago, I realized that I&#8217;m a

                  in iTunes whose names start with
                  &#8220;A&#8221;, &#8220;B&#8221;, or
                  &#8220;D&#8221;, than I am with the ones who

                  &#8220;The Perfect is the enemy of the
                  Good&#8221;: A recent NYT article about
                  &#8220;lean startups&#8221; brought a lot of
                  different thoughts to mind for me. The actual
                  focus of the article is moderately interesting,
                  but more importantly, it raises a core question
                  around balancing (a) the need and desire for
                  perfection, against (b) actually getting
                  something _done_.
